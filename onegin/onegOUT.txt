
A due respect for his afflictions
And entertain the nearly dead
And pass him medicines morosely
And, oh, how base to pamper grossly
But God, what deadly boredom, brothers
By falling gravely ill, he's won
May his example profit others
My uncle, man of firm convictions
Not daring once to steal away
The devil take you, Uncle. Di
The only clever thing he's done
To fluff the pillows for his head
To tend a sick man night and day
While thinking under every sigh

And entertain the nearly dead
To fluff the pillows for his head
The only clever thing he's done
While thinking under every sigh
The devil take you, Uncle. Di
